# Unit Tests
This package uses some unit tests for the code in the repository. The test engine used is 
**pytest**.

The test coverage is far from 100%! Don't rely on them too much.

Always make sure that all tests pass before committing.

Some tests don't contain any asserts. That's because it's too complicated to write/design them but
the test is still of value because it checks whether some function can be called with realistic
parameters without throwing any errors. 

**TODO**: Add more tests.
